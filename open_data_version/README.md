This version (the qmd and pdf files) of the analysis uses [intermediate data files](https://zenodo.org/record/8252388) we have processed from [the public tree](https://hgwdev.gi.ucsc.edu/~angie/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/) to allow our methodology to be reproduced. This is a more restricted dataset from the full GISAID dataset (which cannot be reshared with non-GISAID users), but allows reproduction of the core temporal results.
